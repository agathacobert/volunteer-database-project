# Volunteer Database Project

## Description 
This program is something I developed because during my time volunteering at a nonprofit organizing, scanning and filling documents, I found it was becoming difficult to track my progress and the hours worked on paper. So I developed a code to make the work record easier so that my manager could have access to the hours worked and other volunteers could see where I left off so that they could pick up.

### What are the features?
- **Log hours worked efficiently.**
- **Provide managers with easy access to work records.**
- **Allow volunteers to view progress and pick up tasks where others left off.**
- **Streamline task tracking for improved collaboration.**

#### Feel free to contribute to my project!
